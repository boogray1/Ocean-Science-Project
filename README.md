# Ocean-Science-Project

Python code imports temperature (degC) and resistivity data from excel file and displays data.

Instructions for Use: Download the Jupyter Notebook python code and excel document, then replace the filepath in the code as appropriate.

Objective: import and analyze ocean data relating to the 2015 Axial Seamount eruption (22:00 April 24, 2015)--specifically focusing on identifying the eruption from different available ocean data types (acoustic, temperature, and velocity).

The Temperature (and Resistivity) data used for this project is zipped and available in this repository.  This data was provided using the ooinet.oceanobservatories.org/, creating an account, locating the 'Cabled Axial Seamount International District Vent Field 1 - Medium-Power JBox (MJ03C) - Hydrothermal Vent Fluid Temperature and Resistivity' and restricing the data to the following time: April 1,2015 - May 31, 2015.  The result of this data selection was split into 3 separate documents, which were appended into one file (and appropriatly renamed) and zipped for user convenience.

The Acoustic data used for this project was obtained by taking screenshots of relevent waveform data on www.iris.edu/app/station_monitor/ at the following stations: https://www.iris.edu/app/station_monitor/#2015-04-25T00:00:00/NV-NC89/webicorder/NV-NC27|11010219 and https://www.iris.edu/app/station_monitor/#2015-04-22T06:11:26/IU-MIDW/webicorder/IU-MIDW|5111620.
The first station is near to the eruption (along the Juan de Fuca Plate) , the second is in the central Pacific ocean (much farther away). This data was not imported and instead analyzed visually.
